This program takes in orders and shipments of chicks and calculates the price of them. Each "day" that passes, the chicks price raises a little.

Overall, I think everything in the program works fine. I hope the comments I left make it easy to follow. 

SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS:
The input file should not have any extra spaces after each record. (For example, a line [O, name, 300, 3] should not 
be [O, name, 300, 3     ] ). This causes the program to error, due to how my delimiter is set up.

Besides that, any files that follow the same record format should work.
